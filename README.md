MetroForSteamInstaller (Java)
=============================

This is the Java version of the Metro installer in case you'd like to use that because you don't have .NET framework 4.5.

Building
--------
Because I was way too lazy to do it in a proper way, you have to include zip4j, jna, jna_platform and commons-io in your build path. Have fun with that dirty code.

This whole thing is provided "as is", I'm not responsible for data loss, harm done to your pets or random death encounters in your personal life. You use this on your own risk.  
I'm in no way proud of this thing here and I probably won't improve it as long as all the features work. Thank you for your understanding.
